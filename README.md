# Senior-Project-Powerlifting-App

#
  To assist powerlifters or people interested in developing a more strategic way of planning and documenting workout plans. The project I am developing will be focused on powerlifting and having the ability to create programs, convert kilograms to pounds specifically designed for when using calibrated plates, and to keep track of progress over time. The purpose of this is for convenience for anyone who performs in the powerlifting sport or takes the gym seriously, the application aims to be an all-around full package when it comes organizing your workouts or even potentially to create programs for multiple people if you are for example a coach. We focus on providing the user with convenience when being in the gym and to help measure their progress throughout their lifting journey. The application will be done so as a mobile application which is going to be implemented through Flutter and the Dart programming language.
